description.English=A scenario for Mansions of Madness Second Edition.\n\n<i>You have heard rumours of some strange goings on at the Rowley Asylum. The establishment is run by a renowned medical practitioner by the name of Doctor Joyce Little. Having no solid evidence to initiate a formal or sanctioned investigation - you find yourself using somewhat, unorthodox methods to gain entry. Maybe you can uncover the truth about this unusually private establishment.</i>\n\nThis scenario only requires tiles, tokens and monsters from the base game. However it will use content from any expansions in your content library (RN, SM, BtT, SoA and SoT).\n\nIf you find any bugs or have any issues please report them on my GitHub page:\nhttps://goo.gl/qNrgfk\n\nThe Valkyrie community would really appreciate your feedback on any of the Homebrew scenarios. Feedback helps Valkyrie content creators to improve existing scenarios and make better ones in the future. Please check out the poll on Board Game Geek and submit your vote:\nhttps://goo.gl/CQb2Rc\n
